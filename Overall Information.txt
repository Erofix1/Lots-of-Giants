/// Credits:

Pelipoika - Made the original Be The Giant Deflector Heavy plugin.

PC Gamer - Shared his "besamurai" and "bebeepman" plugins which allowed me to make Giants give weapons and hats to players, make a message appear in the chat when player turns into a giant.
Recommended to remove unused stuff from the code and helped with giving Giants full RAGE or Ubercharge.

Jaster - Released the "Extra Giants v4". Which was an inspiration and a Guide/Instructions in in making these Giant Robots.
Some of his giants were used and changed.

StormishJustice - Used his slightly modified version of Be The Giant Deflector Heavy .sp file which all these giants are made on.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Lots of Giants v2.2
There are 67 Giants.

/// Description:

This pack makes ALL Giant Robots from Mann vs. Machine playable.
Including Boss Giants and Unused Giants.

As well as Custom Giants I made.
Ther Commands are at the bottom of this file.


/// VERY IMPORTANT:

All Giants will give you a Weapon they use as well as the Hat they wear and after you stop being a giant you will lose those weapons and hats.

Critboost gained from Giants is only removed upon death, class change or Giant Change.

On non-MvM maps, Weapons that Giants drop will still have ther stats and anyone that picks them up will have it's stats.
You can remove weapon drops by typing the following command into the server console:

sm_cvar tf_dropped_weapon_lifetime 0


Some Giant's stats were changed to make the more unique while some now wear hats so you can tell them apart from other Giants.
For more information about these changes see the "Overall Changes.txt" file.
It will also inform you about some minor bugs.
