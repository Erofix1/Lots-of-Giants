These are the things I want to add in the future.
I'm not a coding expert so I don't know how to add these things:

- A second spawn sound along side the main one for bosses.
(The second sound only plays for players who are the boss with that unique spawn sound).

- An annoucment in chat what player became which Giant Robot.

- Solve a server crash when becoming any type of Giant Sniper while being Heavy.
(I made Giant Sniper and Giant SMG Sniper but do to the crash they are removed for now).

- Solve a problem where sometimes HUD elements like Soldier's Banner Charge Bar or Sandman ball re-charge bar not showing.

- Make giants take fixed backstab damage.
(Normal Giants will take 500).
(Bosses take 5000 damage).
