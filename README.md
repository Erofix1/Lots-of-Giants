# Lots-of-Giants
- Lots of Giants has every Giant Robot Valve made (even the unused ones) playable. 
- I also added custom Giants that I made up. 
- Some changes were made for QoL stuff or to compansate for a needed change (more info in other files). 
- I also included a version of the files that don't need Root (Admin) flag in order to be used (Only for pure, uncontrolled mayhem). 
- Earlier versions can found on AlliedModders.

## To do

These are the things I want to add in the future. I'm not a coding expert so I don't know how to add these things:

- A second spawn sound along side the main one for bosses. 
(The second sound only plays for players who are the boss with that unique spawn sound).

- An annoucment in chat what player became which Giant Robot.

- Solve a server crash when becoming any type of Giant Sniper while being Heavy. (I made Giant Sniper and Giant SMG Sniper but do to the crash they are removed for now).

- Solve a problem where sometimes HUD elements like Soldier's Banner Charge Bar or Sandman ball re-charge bar not showing.

- Add a command that allows to change required flag while server is running to allow others to use the command.
(Idk if this is already a thing but it will make my job easier by just updating one type of version).

- DONE - Make giants take fixed backstab damage. - CODE MADE BY HIGPS 
(Normal Giants will take 500). 
(Bosses take 5000 damage).
